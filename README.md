# BestBoardGames

Welcome to my 'gem'! This app will scrape top-level data from BoardGameGeek.com's ranked games page, allowing you to view lists of a desired length. From that list, you can enter the rank number of the game to view its specific details.

The instructions in the CLI are self explanatory; the one piece of advise I will provide is to enter your input commands without the quotations around the text. For example, when requesting to view the top twenty board games from the main menu, you would type

  $ twenty

and then simply hit enter! The prompts are designed to work without single quotes, double quotes, or any punctuation. Have fun!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'best_board_games'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install best_board_games

## Usage


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
